                        <p>Onychectomy, commonly referred to as "declawing" is a painful surgical procedure where the third phalanx is removed. The term onychectomy implies removal of just the claw, therefore, a more appropriate term for this inhumane procedure would be phalangectomy because they are actually removing the tips of the cat's toes. It is actually impossible to completely remove just the claw. This procedure is common in the US, however, in many countries worldwide, it is outlawed because it is inhumane.</p>

                        <p>&quot;The amputation of the distal phalanx is indicated in case of chronic inflammatory processes, tumours, persistent and severe infections and gangrene that are limited to the distal phalanx. The procedure is usually limited to the affected claw, leaving the healthy claws &40;if any&41; intact.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Cases where onychectomy is truly in the best interest of the cat are rare and unless it is life-saving, it can be argued that it really isn't going to improve the cat's condition and therefore wouldn't really be medically indicated.</p>

                        <p>&quot;Elective onychectomy&quot; accounts for most declaws done. A majority of declaws performed in North America are done to prevent the cat from scratching the furniture, or to keep the cat from scratching people. They will say they are doing it to keep the cat from acting out and being returned to the shelter. Another common reason for elective declawing is that some privately owned rental properties insist that residents cannot have a cat unless it has been declawed. Public housing cannot legally require that cats be declawed due to legislation that passed in 2007 banning housing authorities from requiring cats be declawed. In California &40;2012&41; and Rhode Island &40;2013&41; this applies to all landlords, not just houring authorities.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Some North American veterinarians hold the position that people with compromised immune systems, due to conditions such as AIDS, should have their cats declawed to prevent health risks to themselves. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control affirms declawing as an option, but acknowledges the controversy and offers the alternative of avoiding situations where scratching might occur. Similarly, the National Institutes of Health &40;NIH&41; suggests avoiding rough play. As a precautionary measure, Familydoctor.org advises people should avoid provoking cats into scratching them.&quot;</p>
